# Content-Monetization-Modeler
Problem Statement:
As video creators and media companies increasingly rely on platforms like YouTube for income, predicting potential ad revenue becomes essential for business planning and content strategy. Your task is to build a Linear Regression model that can accurately estimate YouTube ad revenue for individual videos based on various performance and contextual features, and implement the results in a simple Streamlit web application.
TOOLS USED:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle
streamlit
matplotlib  
seaborn

The data set has been uploaded and EDA has been done and the null values and duplicates has been removed using python and pandas. The EDA such as bivariante and univariate analysis has been done to gain insights and analyse the data.

Then the data set has been separated into features and target and numerical features has been scaled using standard scaler and onehot encoder has been used to encode the categorical features and five regeression models has been tested such as linear regression model, elastic net model, decision tree, random forest and SVR model has been used to predict the target.
